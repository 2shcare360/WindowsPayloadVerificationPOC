# WindowsPayloadVerificationPOC
This POC demonstrates the ability to call a windows cmd/exe expecting to receive a zip file with payload and manifest. Then it unzips the zip file received from the cmd/exe and verifies the payload with he manifest. Post verification it generates a JSON file with verification results.
